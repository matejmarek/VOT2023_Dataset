 # presentation_mosaic

This is a program to make a video mosaic out of images for a VOT presentation.
The parameters will be: 1920:1080 and frame rate: 30, but you can easily change them in the program.
You can see an example of a frame in this directory.
## Preparations

I assume that your structure looks like this:
<i>
* (source folder)
    * (folder with name of the object)
        * color
            * 00001.png/.jpeg/.jpg
            * 00002.png/.jpeg/.jpg
            * ...
    * (folder with name of the object)
    * ...
</i>

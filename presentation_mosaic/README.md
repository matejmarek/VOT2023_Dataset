 # presentation_mosaic

This is a program to make a video mosaic out of images for VOT presentation.

## Preparations

I assume that your structure looks like this:
<i>
* (source folder)
    * (folder with name of the object)
        * color
            * 00001.png/.jpeg/.jpg
            * 00002.png/.jpeg/.jpg
            * ...
    * (folder with name of the object)
    * ...
</i>

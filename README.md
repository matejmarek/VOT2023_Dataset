# VOT_dataset_presentation_3
This is the fourth version of VOT web 2023 and future dataset presentation creation guide. Hopefully finished...


*the majority of the site is borrowed from the original VOT site. I assume that they don't work without their JS files, but when merged with the parent
website, the anchors should work

**the site stucture:

main.html  -  listStyles.css
           -  sequenceRow.css
           -  01_inputUpdateNeeded.js
           -  actionManagment.js
           -  previewDevelopment.js  
           -  navigationList.js
